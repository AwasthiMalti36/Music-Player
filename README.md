<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

**My Music** is a full stack web application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). The app allows users to stream their favorite songs, create playlists, and manage their music library efficiently. This project helped me improve my MERN stack development skills and gave me a platform to implement features with a seamless user interface.

Developed by **Aditya Mishra**, this music player uses **Napster's API** for streaming music and offers an intuitive user experience. The project also integrates **Tailwind CSS** for modern, responsive styling.
